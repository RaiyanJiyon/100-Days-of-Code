# 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code repository! This repository documents my journey through the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.

## About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Daily Progress**: Folders for each day of my coding journey, containing code files and any other relevant materials. Each folder follows the naming convention "DD-DayN-" where DD represents the day number and N represents the day.
- **Log of Activities**: A daily log where I document my progress, challenges faced, and insights gained during each day of the challenge.
- **Additional Resources**: Links to useful resources, articles, and tutorials that supplement my learning throughout the bootcamp.
- **Projects**: Any projects or mini-projects completed during the bootcamp, along with documentation and explanations.

## Getting Started
